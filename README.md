# MyFirstApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Practice Project with Recipes

This is a small single page application with no backend. This project is concentrated on the use of Angular, therefore the styling is limited.
The application should display two recipes which can be edited/deleted, new recipes can be added and a shopping list which stores the ingredients required for each recipe.
